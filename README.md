### 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Model & Visualization Project
**Tools:** SQL, Qlik Cloud Analytics

**Summary:** Leveraging data to proactively retain customers and drive business growth.
This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytical approach to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. I utilized MySQL for robust data cleaning and engineering insightful new features, then employed Qlik Cloud Analytics' ML capabilities to build and evaluate a predictive model. The resulting Qlik Sense dashboard provides interactive visualizations of key churn drivers and actionable insights, enabling targeted strategies to reduce customer churn and optimize retention efforts.
