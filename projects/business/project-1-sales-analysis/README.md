## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end analytical approach to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. I utilized MySQL for robust data cleaning and engineering insightful new features, then employed Qlik Cloud Analytics' AutoML capabilities to build and evaluate a predictive model. The resulting Qlik Sense dashboard provides interactive visualizations of key churn drivers and actionable insights, enabling targeted strategies to reduce customer attrition and optimize retention efforts.

    <strong>Customer Churn Prediction Project: Driving Retention with Qlik Analytics</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This project identifies customers at high risk of churning to provide a telecommunications company with actionable insights for proactive retention and minimized revenue loss. The end-to-end analysis involved data preparation in MySQL, predictive modeling using Qlik ML, and developing interactive dashboards to visualize the findings.

  <h4>Data Source &amp; Preparation</h4>
  <p>
    The project utilized a comprehensive Telecom Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle, containing customer attributes, service usage, and billing information. While the data quality was generally high, some cleaning and feature engineering were performed. I used GenAI (Gemini and ChatGPT) to convert the initial CSV to a SQL script and to generate randomized "apply" datasets for prediction, with one trial set of 500 rows and a final set of 6,858 rows. GenAI also assisted with initial complex SQL queries (DECIMAL, REPLACE, REGEXP), while the remaining queries were manually written.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Data Cleaning &amp; Feature Engineering in MySQL</h4>
  <p>
    The dataset was cleaned, and new features were engineered directly within a MySQL database to optimize it for predictive modeling.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Initial Cleaning and Type Conversion of Total Charges:</strong> Empty strings and non-numeric characters in the <code>Total Charges</code> column were removed, and the column was converted to a <code>DECIMAL(10, 2)</code> data type for accurate calculations.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering New Features:</strong> Four new features were added to enhance the model's predictive power:
        <ul>
            <li><em>Tenure Months Binned:</em> Tenure was categorized into bins ('0-12 Months', '13-24 Months', etc.) to analyze churn across lifecycle stages.</li>
            <li><em>Total Service Addons:</em> An integer quantifying the number of add-on services to assess customer engagement.</li>
            <li><em>Has Paperless Electronic Payment:</em> A binary flag for customers using both 'PaperlessBilling' and 'Electronic check', a combination hypothesized to correlate with churn.</li>
            <li><em>Average Monthly Charge Per Tenure:</em> Calculated as <code>TotalCharges / tenure</code> to measure consistent financial engagement.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Standardizing Categorical Values:</strong> Binary '0' and '1' values were converted to 'No' and 'Yes' for clarity.</li>
    <li><strong>Column Renaming:</strong> Underscores were removed from new column names for consistency (e.g., <code>Tenure_Months_Binned</code> became <code>TenureMonthsBinned</code>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Predictive Modeling with Qlik ML</h4>
  <p>
    Using Qlik Cloud Analytics' ML capabilities, a binary classification model was developed to predict churn. Qlik's AutoML streamlined the process by training multiple algorithms (CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, etc.) on a training set, with performance validated against a 20% holdout set.
  </p>

  <h4>Key Findings &amp; Model Performance</h4>
  <p>
    The CatBoost Classification model was the top performer on the holdout data.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Key Performance Metrics (on Holdout Data):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>F1-Score:</strong> 0.613</li>
    <li><strong>AUC:</strong> 0.827</li>
    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> 0.749</li>
    <li><strong>Recall:</strong> 0.749 (Identified ~75% of actual churners)</li>
    <li><strong>Precision:</strong> 0.519</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Top Predictive Features:</strong> The most influential factors in predicting churn were Contract Type, Tenure, Internet Service Type, and Total Charges.</p>

  <h4>Actionable Insights &amp; Recommendations</h4>
  <p>Based on the model's insights, the following actions are recommended:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Target Month-to-Month Customers:</strong> Develop incentives to encourage commitment to longer-term contracts.</li>
    <li><strong>Early Intervention for New Customers:</strong> Proactively monitor and support customers in their first few months.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Quality Review:</strong> Investigate and improve service for internet types associated with high churn.</li>
    <li><strong>Value-Based Offers:</strong> Ensure high-spending, long-tenure customers perceive value through loyalty benefits or personalized offers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Dashboards &amp; Visualizations</h4>
  <p>
    Interactive dashboards were created in Qlik Sense to make insights accessible. Key visualizations include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>KPIs for Predicted Cancellations &amp; Churn Rate:</strong> An executive summary of the overall churn challenge.</li>
    <li><strong>Impact of Contract Type (Stacked Bar Chart):</strong> Highlights that month-to-month customers are the highest-risk segment.</li>
    <li><strong>Tenure's Influence on Churn Risk (SHAP Scatter Plot):</strong> Shows lower tenure increases churn risk, while higher tenure reduces it.</li>
    <li><strong>Distribution of Churn Across Total Charges (Area Chart):</strong> Identifies spending tiers where churn is most prevalent.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4>Future Predictions &amp; Operationalization</h4>
  <p>
    The deployed Qlik ML model can be used for real-time or batch predictions to flag at-risk customers proactively. It can be integrated into daily operations to generate weekly/monthly reports, such as a list of the top 100 customers most likely to churn, enabling timely intervention.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates the ability to leverage SQL and advanced analytics tools like Qlik ML to solve real-world business problems by transforming raw data into predictive insights and actionable recommendations.
